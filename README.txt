== Description ==

AMS Cache is an extremely lightweight, high-performance cache plugin that speeds up your WordPress sites on the fly. The core of AMS Cache is driven by Shieldon Simple Cache, a PSR-16 simple cache library.

Core library:

- [terrylinooo/simple-cache](https://github.com/terrylinooo/simple-cache) (Simple Cache library)

First release date: October, 1, 2020

== Features ==

* Extremely lightweight and high-performance.
* Support up to 10 cache drivers such as File, Redis, Memcache, Memcached, APC, APCu, WinCache, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB.
* Provide detailed cache statistics, easy to manage.
* Vite-built React admin console using HeroUI components and Tailwind CSS 4.3 design tokens, with live status, settings views, requirement checks, and one-click actions.
* Optional Redis and File cache compression.
* Optional Nginx direct static cache for the File driver.
* Optional page optimization before cache storage: HTML minify, inline/external UCSS generation, JS analysis, lazy media, LCP image priority, Google Fonts preconnect, and guarded JavaScript defer.
* Optional WebP image optimizer for WordPress uploads with background queueing and offload-safe controls.
* Admin bar purge controls for clearing all cache or only the current page.
* Compatible with the WooCommerce plugin.
* And more...

== Nginx Direct Static Cache ==

When using the File driver, AMS Cache can write a raw HTML mirror that Nginx may serve before PHP or WordPress runs. Enable it in Advanced settings, review the requirement checks, copy the generated snippet into your Nginx server block, run nginx -t, then reload Nginx.

== Page Optimization ==

AMS Cache can optimize cacheable guest HTML before it is saved to File, Redis, Memcached, APCu, or another selected driver. Enable it in the Optimization tab. The pipeline includes HTML/comment cleanup, inline CSS minify, conservative PHP UCSS, hashed CSS assets for eligible same-site stylesheets, native lazy loading for media, first-image LCP priority/preload, Google Fonts preconnect, bounded PHP JS analysis, and optional safe JavaScript defer with exclusions.

External UCSS reads only same-site .css files under the WordPress root, skips SRI/crossorigin/alternate/preload/importing stylesheets, obeys the configured max file size, rewrites relative url() assets before publishing a hashed CSS file, and keeps the original link if the PHP engine produces no smaller output.

Large sites can preload up to 1000 URLs. AMS Cache queues preload work in small batches so dashboard actions do not have to wait for every URL in one request.

== Vite and Tailwind Admin Console ==

The AMS Cache admin console uses native WordPress admin screens, Vite-built assets that bundle React and HeroUI, and Tailwind CSS 4.3 design tokens. The console covers cache, preload, performance, rules, statistics, expert, benchmark, WooCommerce, and about views, with AJAX controls for refresh, preload, homepage purge, image queueing, and full cache clear.

Build assets with:

`bun install`
`bun run build`

Build a release zip with:

`bun run build:release`

One-command version bump and release:

`bun run release`
`bun run release:minor`
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\bin\release.ps1 -Version 3.1.0 -Note "Release dashboard polish."`

`bin/release.ps1` defaults to a patch bump. It syncs `cache-master.php`, `SCM_PLUGIN_VERSION`, `README.txt` stable tag, `package.json`, React about-page labels, and `CHANGELOG.md`, then calls `bin/build-release.ps1`. The release script runs Bun install/build and verifies the Vite manifest before packaging.

The Performance view records recent cache writes and shows what actually happened on each page: bytes before/after, total bytes saved, Local UCSS and External UCSS bytes removed, JS Analysis deferred/analyzed counts, image optimizer status, and feature-level states such as Applied, No change, Disabled, or Failed. Older reports created before the local engines existed may still show Pending engine.

All settings forms save in place through authenticated WordPress AJAX requests with nonce and capability checks. The React console writes the same WordPress options used by the cache runtime, so existing option update hooks still run.

Built assets are required for the React console. The release script verifies the Vite manifest before packaging.

== Local UCSS, External UCSS, and JS Analysis ==

AMS Cache uses built-in PHP engines for Local UCSS, External UCSS, and JS Analysis. Production does not require Bun, Node, PurgeCSS, Composer, or shell_exec. The legacy executable fields remain only for saved-setting compatibility. Bun and frontend packages are build-machine dependencies; run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run build` before packaging. Optimization workspaces and runtime config use a private temp directory outside public uploads when available.

Use the UCSS safelist for dynamic classes JavaScript adds after load. Local UCSS targets inline page CSS. External UCSS targets eligible same-site stylesheet files and inlines optimized output into cached guest HTML. If one CSS block or stylesheet is malformed, AMS Cache keeps that block or stylesheet raw and still optimizes valid items.

== Image Optimization ==

AMS Cache can generate WebP variants for WordPress image attachments. Enable Image Optimization in the Performance settings, set quality, and use Queue Images to process the newest 200 JPEG/PNG/WebP attachments. New uploads are optimized automatically when Optimize images on upload is enabled.

AMS Cache now uses WebP as the only output and primary upload format. The generated .webp file can become the WordPress attachment file for new uploads before offload plugins sync the attachment. Originals stay on disk for backup/compatibility, but the attachment URL can point to WebP after successful conversion.

The image engine uses Bun Image for local WebP generation and tiny loading placeholders. If Bun cannot create WebP, AMS Cache falls back to the native WordPress image editor. Use an absolute Bun binary path in the Performance settings if PHP cannot see bun in its PATH. Verify the image optimizer with:

`bun --version`
`bun run image:check`

Image placeholders store a short, safe data:image/...;base64 preview in attachment optimization metadata. When Image placeholders is enabled, AMS Cache adds that preview as an inline background while the real WebP image loads.

Safety rules:

* Original uploads are never overwritten.
* Writes are restricted to generated variant files beside existing images inside wp-content/uploads.
* GIF, SVG, unknown mime types, and files outside uploads are skipped.
* Background batches are capped to avoid long admin or cron requests.
* HTML rewrite only happens when generated variant metadata exists.
* The Bun optimizer receives only upload-directory source and output paths, validates real paths before writing, and generated placeholder data URLs are length and mime-type restricted before HTML output.

Offload compatibility:

* Default mode is safe for WP Offload Media and Advanced Offload Media because remote/offloaded URL rewriting is disabled.
* If your offload plugin syncs generated .webp files to the same remote path, you may enable Allow offloaded remote URL rewrite.
* Original image files stay intact; new-upload attachment metadata can point to the generated WebP file after successful conversion.

Notice:

Before you install and use this plugin, please read the following notices carefully:

- Logged-in users will not trigger the caching process.
- A debug message will be appended to the end of the page's source code: `<!-- This page is cached by the AMS Cache plugin. //-->`. This is intended for debugging purposes only, confirming that the page is being cached. This message can be disabled in the Settings page.

If you encounter issues with your website when using AMS Cache, list all plugins installed on your website when reporting the problem.

== Installation ==

- Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/ams-cache directory, or install the plugin directly through the WordPress plugins screen.
- Activate the plugin via the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
- Navigate to the AMS Cache menu in the Plugins section and configure your options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I disable other cache plugins? =

AMS Cache caches entire webpages into static HTML files. Therefore, it is recommended to disable other similar cache plugins that perform the same function. However, it can function alongside object cache plugins without issue.

= How can I determine whether the caching is working or not? =

Be aware that logged-in users will not trigger the caching process. To verify caching, use incognito mode or a different browser to revisit the same webpage, and then you can check the cache status in one of the following ways:

- View the source code of the webpage and check the debug message as shown in screenshot (L).
- Enable the benchmark information in the footer section as shown in screenshot (K), where you can see the cache status.

If there is no debug message in the source code, or if the cache status consistently displays 'No', there might be a plugin conflict with AMS Cache that prevents it from working correctly.
